Relationships are someting that are continuously worked at. At one point my gradmother told that love is like a
like a fire, it eventually dies. To an extent, this is true. What my grandmother didn't tell me me was that there
is more to love than, just let it die. Yes, love is like a fire in a sense that if you do not continue feeding
it wood, it will die. Love continously requires both parties to contribute ideas, efforts, work, joy, and sorrow.

Of course, there are relationships that just don't work - one should always be mindful and honest of what it is 
they want (selfishness is truly a virtue). Though this does require a the ability to learn from reflection - that 
being said if this is not present at the moment the relationship begins - chaotic turbulence is inevitable. As in
order for a relationship to be sustainable, one must be able to reflect during the chaos to see the progress that
has been made, and though the current moment may not appear to be what one or both parties want, progress was
required to get there. And  reflection allows us to see that. For then, wood is needed for the fire.
