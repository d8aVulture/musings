Can an Ohite teach Python

"To command Nature we must be above Nature, by resistance of her attractions. If
your mind be perfectly free from all prejudice, superstition and incredulity, you
will rule spirits. If you do not obey blind forces, they will obey you. If you be wise
like Solomon, you will perform the works of Solomon; if you be holy like Christ,
you will accomplish the works of Christ. To direct the currents of the inconstant
light, we must be established in the constant light. To command the elements, we
must have overcome their hurricanes, their lightnings, their abysses, their tem-
pests. In order to DARE we must KNOW; in order to WILL, we must DARE; we must
WILL to possess empire and to reign we must BE SILENT."
