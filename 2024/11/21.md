When you want to know how it runs, go ghidra. Cause I would rather be a dick than a swallower. As our time in Texas comes to an end - I can't help but feel a slightbitterness that Austin carries a facade the it can be effecient and innovative
within the tech industry. Though this place holds a dear place in my heart (as its where I met my future wife). It saddens me that a majority ogf people here hold
their tongue - when the oppresors pretend to lead.
