The acceptance of support - to proceed with ones desires. To create stability for
the ideas that create a spark in you. Embracing the omens that come your way. As 
the delusion that wolves stray to be isolated has detered us from the truth - that
the wolf strives for a community, and understands that community is required to be
powerful.


EVERY intention which does not assert itself by deeds is a vain intention...

Embrace the work that has been done leading up to now, ideas are not meant to be taken as premonitions, but as oppurtunities to fork. In order for to create a sustainable idea, we must be able to, with pride remove everything within the idea that fascinates you, and fork it. Work withit as a crutch until yourconcept is ready to scale.
