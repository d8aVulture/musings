Resignation - this is my resignation to all toxic work enviroments. As I part
ways from an "SEO" company that thrives on the short comings and fears of
thousands of blue collar workers in the US. This company is one of many that that
takes advantage of a majority of the working class that fears technological
change. The fear that comes from your everyday trademens is staggering, This also includes lawyers within the following: criminal defense, intellectual properyt, family law, coporate law, family, real estate, immigration and personal injury. The number of conversations I'v had onboarding these workers and lawyers mostly contained two big challenges. one, having to do damage control from the false pitch - scripted to feed of the insecurities, to pursuade an individual who has finally decided to embrace an online pressence and the customer who has already been burned by several other "SEO" companies, just taking whatever last hail marry that can preserve their failing business.
