Faith - something that not only applies to religion. But, our well being - something that at times, comes and goes. There are times in which the mission I have been investing in, reaches points where I no longer believe in it. I have come to learn that these are partly projections of fear. But, also that faith is always present. Lack of faith, comes from the misplacement of the enviroment. The situation - if we were placed where we excelled, I believe faith would always be all powerful. Like the song "True Love will find you in the end", faith will find you. Forever work towards what it is that creates a spark within.
