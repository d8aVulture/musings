Do you realize how much you talk down on yourself?

The second challenge I faced when onboarding these customers, is that they had close to no experience on how to even maneuver through a desktop. There were times in which I would spend 30+ minutes, just getting them on a Google meet (and that does not include getting them to share their screen). Connecting our platform to all the social media accounts, accounts that have not been touched in years - do to the customer immediately losing interest in the progression of his digital identity. Dragging them through process of regaining access as they attempt to make their final financial hail mary to salvage their dying trades business (or law practice). And connect them to an "SEO" platform that does what? Provides trivial tasks to the consumer to - stabalize an online pressence, at best. Simple updates to couple dozen relevant, and irrelevant online directorties. Aside from that, in my opinion, the platform is useless when stripped of its high LSA and ADs costs.
