Faggoto - is the word. My sister used to call me this as a child. I always found it very
humourous. My emotions have been my reckonning - regardless of how heavily I practiced 
"rationality". As I exit the old ways of my past, going through what we reference as a 
recursion, with a new perspective. Emotions appear, a background presence. And, more 
silly when coming up in a more self destructive, insecure manner. The waves of life will
forever, and always come in flibs in flobs - thats beyond us. But the way we view them, 
with joyous pleasure - is up to us.
